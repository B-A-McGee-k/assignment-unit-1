    <!-- Create an unordered list with 3 list items of fun facts about you -->
      <p>Just to show that I know how to do my own lists, here's a bit about me!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In the past year I've started going to concerts, and they are so fun!</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of the game Magic: the Gathering and have recently been trying other tabletop games.</li>
            <li>Frisbee golf is better than regular golf!</li>
            <li>It just is! Trust me!</li>
            <li>In my freshman year of high school, I made a website to keep track of all my assignments.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>of course there's also the ordered list</li>
        </ol>  
      <p>Silly ordered lists thinking they're all that.</p>
      <p>You know what any good website has?</p>
      <ol>
        <li>different colors?</li>
        <li style="font-size:30px;">maybe different size text?</li>
      </ol>
          <p> No! Cats!</p>

          <br>
          <h6>That <i>might</i> be too much cat for this website...</h6> 
      <ol>
        <li>probably needed to change the size</li>
      </ol>

    <p>That looks better now!</p>

      <h4>A Built in Question</h4>
      <p>So I am a little confused by the set up of the material.</p>
      <p>Nothing major enough that I felt I should ask, as I feel this will make it's way out as a major subject.</p>
      <p>I'm not sure between the two seperate tutorials being given per say which to go with.</p>
      <p>The one used as a reference for how everything works (Link given to us via Unit-1) shows how to completely start from scratch.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Link in reference <a rel="here" href="https://tier1.primeacademy.io/unit1">here</a>. Just scroll to "HTML and CSS"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If that was the intended way, then I can get right on it.</p>
      <p>If I asked every question that I had, we'd never get to sleep so I might leave these on my projects at times.</p>
      <p>Just like a ps on a letter that gives me more practice with features.</p>
